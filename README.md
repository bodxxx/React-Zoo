# This is online pet store was created with React. 
## There are a lot of bugs and controversial decisions on this project, but this was only my first react project.
### The purpose of this project was to get to know this framework and improve the skills and knowledge of javascript.
- I used npm to build  this project.
- I was developing this project by video on youtube
- During the process I've learnt what is React in general. 
- I got acquainted with such things as useState, useContext, useEffect, React Router etc. 
- Back-end part is done with help of mockApi service, also axios library was used.
